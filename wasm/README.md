# Browser WebAssembly Demo

This directory contains a WebAssembly build of the browser that runs entirely in your web browser.

## Files

- `index.html` - The demo web page
- `wasm_exec.js` - Go's WebAssembly JavaScript support file
- `browser.wasm` - The compiled WebAssembly binary (generated by build script)

## Building

From the repository root, run:

```bash
./build-wasm.sh
```

Or use the Makefile:

```bash
make build-wasm
```

## Running

1. Build the WASM module (see above)

2. Start a local web server in this directory:
   ```bash
   cd wasm
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:8080 in your web browser

## Quick Start with Make

From the repository root:

```bash
make serve-wasm
```

This will build the WASM module and start a web server in one command.

## Usage

1. Enter HTML (with inline CSS in `<style>` tags) in the left panel
2. Adjust viewport width and height if desired
3. Click "Render" to see the result
4. The rendered image will appear in the right panel

## Example Pages

The demo includes several example pages:
- **Simple** - Basic HTML with minimal styling
- **Colors** - Colored boxes demonstrating CSS colors
- **Layout** - Header/content/footer layout
- **Text Styles** - Various text styling options (bold, italic, underline, different sizes)

## Browser Support

Requires a modern browser with WebAssembly support:
- Chrome 57+
- Firefox 52+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

## Notes

- The browser renders HTML/CSS to a PNG image
- Only inline CSS in `<style>` tags is supported (no external stylesheets in WASM mode)
- Network features (loading external resources) are not available in WASM mode
- Image support is limited in WASM mode due to cross-origin restrictions
